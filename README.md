## Introduction
Ping Pong Game is a simple C++ project using OOP concepts and the raylib library. It features object-oriented design with classes for ball, paddle, and game logic, showcasing encapsulation, abstraction, and interaction through real-time graphics and user input handling.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- VS code
- Raylib
- raymath.h
- GitHub

## Features
- Ball and paddle movement
- Collision detection
- CPU AI
- Sound effects
- Scoring system

## Object-Oriented Design
Each component (Ball, Player, CPU) is implemented as a separate class to follow OOP principles.

## Testing and Validation
Manual testing ensured correct paddle-ball collisions, scoring logic, and responsive controls.

## Conclusion
The game runs smoothly with clean, maintainable code using OOP practices.
