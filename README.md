# 🎮 2D Ping Pong Game

A classic 2D Ping Pong game developed in **C++** using the **Raylib** graphics library. This project demonstrates the application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design. It features responsive gameplay, simple AI, and real-time interaction with visual and audio feedback.

## 📌 Introduction
The Ping Pong Game is a C++ desktop application built using Raylib for graphics and input handling. It models key OOP principles by organizing the game into distinct classes such as `Ball`, `Player`, `CPU`, and `GameController`. The game delivers an interactive experience with real-time rendering, keyboard input, and game physics like paddle-ball collisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Visual Studio Code
- Raylib (graphics and input)
- raymath.h (math utilities)
- GitHub (version control and collaboration)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time paddle and ball movement
- Accurate collision detection
- CPU paddle with simple AI behavior
- Score tracking system
- Sound effects on collision
- Game reset on scoring

---

## 🔄 Object-Oriented Design
The code is structured using OOP principles:
- **Encapsulation:** Game logic is contained within classes like `Ball`, `Player`, and `CPU`.
- **Abstraction:** Each class hides internal logic and exposes clear interfaces.
- **Modularity:** Code is cleanly separated into reusable components.

---

## ✅ Testing and Validation
- All core game functionalities were tested manually.
- Collision detection between ball and paddles was verified under multiple conditions.
- Scoring logic was tested by allowing the ball to hit both ends of the screen.
- CPU paddle AI was tuned to maintain fair difficulty.
- Sound and input responsiveness were tested during active gameplay.

## 🧾 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how core OOP principles can be applied to a real-time interactive application. The result is a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase that offers a complete and enjoyable gaming experience.
